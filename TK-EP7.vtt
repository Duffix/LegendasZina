Episódio 7: Viagem

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.960
Eles realmente se dão bem.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.990
O marido é tão doce!

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.560
Você quer mesmo separar
um casal tão bonitinho?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.240
Você não tem empatia humana?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.460
Calem-se!

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.510
Não importa o quanto eles se dão bem!

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.080
Ah, ela ficou zangada conosco agora.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.600
Claro que ela está.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.010
Já disse pra ficarem quietas!

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.890
Luas de mel são tão perigosas para os casais que até existe a frase "Divórcio Narita"!

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.270
Divórcio Narita?

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.270
É quando os casais enfrentam pequenos problemas durante a lua de mel

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.630
e então acabam pedindo o divórcio no Aeroporto de Narita!

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.360
Isso mesmo!

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.630
Mesmo pequenos problemas podem acabar com um romance!

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.400
E você vai arranjar esse tipo de problemas?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.660
Eu não preciso fazer isso.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.410
Já estão acontecendo!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.160
Ué?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.520
O que foi?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.330
Sumiu! Não acho minha carteira!

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.800
Essa não, deve estar no ônibus! Eu esqueci!

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.140
Desculpe, espere um pouco aqui!

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.800
Querido!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.760
Francamente...

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.280
Ele esqueceu a carteira?
Que cabeça de vento.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.810
Isso vai deixar a raiva dela
à beira da erupção!

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.300
Achei.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.690
Ué?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.770
Tsukasa-chan? O que foi?

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.250
Você podia ter esperado
na área de descanso.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.450
Bem, eu podia ter esperado, mas...

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.200
Achei melhor ficar com você
do que esperar.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.580
Obrigado. Vamos indo então?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.420
Sim.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.230
Eles se dão muito bem, não é?

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.180
É mesmo.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.840
Aquilo foi só o começo.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.970
Os problemas de verdade
ainda estão por vir!

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.330
Agora entendo porque você estava animada sobre a praça de alimentação.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.460
Ramen, curry e batatas na manteiga!

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.170
Eu nem sei por onde começar.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.910
O que você vai comer, Nasa-kun?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.980
Boa pergunta...

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.760
Acho que vou querer o
gyudon do Hurunoya!

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.240
Querido, você está maluco?

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.220
Por que escolher uma cadeia de restaurantes diante de tais tesouros culinários?

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.080
Você pode comer esse
tipo de coisa em casa!

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.990
M-Mas é tão gostoso...

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.480
Pode ser gostoso, mas há um limite para o quanto você pode comer!

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.260
Por que não experimenta algo novo?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.540
Se você desistir é fim de jogo!

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.000
Então o que você vai comer?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.760
Eu?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.680
Q-Que sorriso destemido é esse?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.060
Ao contrário de você, querido, eu fui muito observadora.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.960
Você não viu a placa que
estava na entrada?

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.320
H-Hirunendesu!

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.400
Isso mesmo! Hirunendesu! Algo que nunca te deixa na mão!

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.030
Então vou comer aquele udon com lima!

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.230
Vou comprar agora mesmo!

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.460
Eles estão se divertindo, não é?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.830
Parece que eles estão se
divertindo bastante.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.740
Pronto, um udon com lima.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.540
Fique com isto e aguarde.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.530
Certo.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.250
Ouça, querido.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.460
Nesta época, os locais com macarrão servem sudachi soba

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.710
que é basicamente macarrão com bastante fruta cítrica sudachi por cima.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.070
Mas este udon com lima só é parecido. Na verdade ele é completamente diferente.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.220
Em primeiro lugar, eles usam lima ao invés de sudachi.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.510
E ao invés de macarrão
soba, eles usam udon.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.530
A semelhança básica consiste

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.670
na vaga semelhança entre os dois.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.860
Isso é uma boa ideia?

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.960
Mas eu pessoalmente aprecio esse espírito de aventura.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.610
Eu quero que você tenha o mesmo gosto para experimentar coisas novas.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.860
Estou indo!

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.800
Não se parece muito com a foto.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.260
B-Bem, eu criei muita expectativa.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.870
Mesmo assim eu vou experimentar.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.230
C-Como está?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.380
Querido...

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.180
Parece que alguém colocou fatias de lima em cima do udon frio.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.510
Por que, Hirunendesu?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.140
É chocante o quanto o sabor não causa surpresa alguma.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.150
O sabor é tão óbvio que chega
a ser inesperado.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.240
V-Você está dizendo que não é bom?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.040
Você devia experimentar, querido.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.860
Vamos, diga "ah".

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.670
De fato... não tem um sabor interessante digno de um comentário.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.850
Não é?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.790
Mas eu não acho ruim.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.870
Pode ser melhor se você comer junto com a fatia de lima.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.480
Q-Querido, está me dizendo
para morder a lima?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.210
Bem, você estava falando sobre experimentar coisas novas, então acho que vale a pena tentar.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.520
Azedo

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.200
Ei! Por que está tirando fotos?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.700
Ué, por que será?

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.950
Você estava tão fofa!

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.440
Pare! Não tire fotos das minhas caretas!

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.410
Vamos, coma mais um pouco!

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.980
Não quero!

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.000
Eles ainda estão se divertindo
bastante, não é?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.620
Quando os problemas deviam
aparecer mesmo?

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.830
Mau

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.830
humor

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.150
Tsukasa-chan?

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.110
Sua implicância comigo me deixou muito magoada.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.600
Esta é uma daquelas situações onde você vai ter que me agradar pra melhorar o meu humor.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.200
O que você vai fazer?

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.310
Aí está!

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.110
Um pequeno problema e agora eles vão direto para o divórcio!

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.180
Então, você quer que eu te compre um sorvete cremoso?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.830
Sorvete cremoso?

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.660
S-Se você acha que isso é o suficiente pra me animar vai ter que se esforçar mais.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.970
Então você pode escolher o que quer comer, Tsukasa-chan.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.750
E vou dividir com você, assim podemos comer juntos.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.790
V-Vou mesmo pedir o que
eu quiser comer, não é?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.720
Claro, vá em frente.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.260
E-Então...

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.660
É gostoso?

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.020
N-Não é ruim.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.150
E já que este pão de melão é a especialidade local, eu creio que vou te perdoar.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.770
Obrigado.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.020
Então, eu preciso ir ao banheiro antes de continuarmos a viagem.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.050
E você?

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.030
Eu vou esperar aqui.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.280
Está bem. Voltarei logo,
então não saia daqui.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.000
Claro.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.790
Parece que aquele pequeno problema...

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.290
Acabou apimentando o relacionamento deles.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.210
Estou tão desapontada.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.690
Mas isto é muito bom.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.970
Não estou falando sobre
o seu pão de melão!

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.270
O que você está fazendo num lugar como este, Nee-sama?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.480
Comendo pão de melão numa área de serviços e ficando toda amorosa com seu marido!

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.780
Como se você fosse uma garota normal!

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.260
Você me superestima.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.740
Desde o dia em que nos conhecemos só estou sendo uma única coisa...

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.040
Uma garota normal de 16 anos.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.280
Isso não é verdade! Você é—

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.250
Pessoal!

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.940
Olá!

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.160
Hoje viemos até uma área de serviços durante a madrugada.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.870
O que é aquilo?

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.940
Aquilo é...

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.630
Hirunendesu!

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.160
É o show da manhã, Hirunendesu!

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Eu sabia que eles apareciam em áreas de serviço algumas vezes,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.270
mas não achei que fossem
estar aqui nessa hora.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.510
Eu fui descuidada.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.270
Nós podemos acabar fazendo parte do ranking deles!

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.800
Tsukasa-chan, o ônibus já vai sair, então nós devíamos...

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.890
Ué, você não é...

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.190
Não temos tempo pra isso!

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.810
Se não corrermos, querido, vamos alimentar o quadro "locais quentes escondidos".

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.220
Esperem aí!

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.280
Nós devíamos sair daqui também.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.440
O quê? Por quê?

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.670
Se aparecermos no Hirunendesu, a patroa vai descobrir onde estamos e ficaremos em apuros!

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.560
Por quê?

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.550
Por que você fez isso?

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.740
Por que...

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.930
Por que você se casou com
esse cara, Nee-sama?

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.270
Estamos partindo agora.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.710
Escapamos por pouco.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.260
Aquela garota há pouco
era a sua conhecida?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.960
Sim, a Chitose.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.940
Parece que ela se opõe ao
nosso casamento.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.220
Acho que isso mostra que um casamento não envolve apenas aqueles que se casam.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.900
Algumas pessoas vão ser contra.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.050
Entendo...

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.600
Imagino o que seus pais vão dizer.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.820
Eles não nos darem os
parabéns é uma coisa,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.610
mas e se eles forem contra?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.540
Está tudo bem.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.340
Tenho certeza que serei
capaz de convencê-los.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.590
Obrigada.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.100
Droga, não acredito que eles fugiram!

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.960
Delicioso! Este sushi de carne é tão bom!

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.020
Este ramen é ótimo também.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.850
Por que você estão desfrutando da área de serviços?

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.710
Vai ficar tudo bem.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.160
Nós temos um carro de luxo onde podemos alcançar o ônibus a qualquer momento.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.570
Então por enquanto, vamos comer!

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.210
E você sempre pede este udon com lima?

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.720
Sim, isso mesmo!

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.240
Parece tão gostoso!

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.190
Vejo que eles colocaram algumas fatias de lima por cima do udon.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.690
Não é aquela Idol, Taki-chan?

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.680
A lima é uma especialidade local daqui?

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.310
Celebridades são realmente fofas.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.750
Não tenho certeza, mas acho que sim.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.750
Vocês duas podiam se concentrar?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.970
Então, o que você gostou mais neste udon com lima?

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.340
E ela trabalha até de madrugada.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.010
Eu acho que é o sabor refrescante.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.900
Uma boa resposta! Lima é realmente refrescante!

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.250
Já sei! Podemos perguntar à ela.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.760
Por alguma razão, eu não consegui tirar aquelas palavras da minha cabeça.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.020
Por que você se casou com esse cara?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.770
O casamento existe há tanto tempo que é difícil rastrear suas origens.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.780
Não há países sem uma
tradição equivalente.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.030
Talvez ele tenha existido antes mesmo dos humanos terem o conhecimento de hoje.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.040
Parece que ela é contra o nosso casamento.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.620
Mesmo que ela seja contra, eu...

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.800
Querido? Querido?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.570
Querido?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.430
Querido, nós já chegamos.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.450
Ah, d-desculpe!

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.900
Bem, você não precisa se desculpar.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.120
Essa foi uma longa viagem.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.190
Eu nem vi o tempo passar.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.810
Leva uns 35 minutos usando a linha Kintetsu até Nara.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.950
Então, se vamos chegar na casa dos meus pais de noite,

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.660
significa que podemos passar metade do dia passeando por Kyoto.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.440
Tsukasa-chan, tem algum lugar
onde você queira ir?

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.590
Um lugar onde eu quero ir?

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.390
Sim!

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.970
Ah, tem sim!

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.710
Eu soube de uma ótima padaria.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.200
Uma padaria?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.420
Sim, uma padaria.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.340
Ou talvez uma pequena e fofa cafeteria!

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.120
E também—

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.610
Tsukasa-chan, você está maluca?

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.400
Temos padaria e cafeterias em Tóquio!

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.960
Se você quer uma cafeteria fofa, Jinbocho está cheio delas!

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.860
Elas vivem cheios de mangakas se reunindo com seus editores!

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.220
Não foi isso que eu perguntei!

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.370
Tem alguma coisa que você queira ver em Kyoto, não é?

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.100
Só em Kyoto?

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.340
Ah, sim, sim! Eu tinha esquecido disso!

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.730
O Museu de Mangás!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.020
Eu sempre quis dar uma passada lá.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.910
Acho que deve ser aqui
perto, então vamos—

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.120
Não é isso!

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.630
Nós estamos em Kyoto!

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.840
Com santuários e templos para visitarmos!

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.510
Tradição é a missão, visão
histórica é atração!

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.370
Não tenho certeza se era
necessário cantar rap.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.840
Ah, você quer dizer lugares antigos...

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.310
Lugares antigos?

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.020
Tsukasa-chan, você não tem interesse em coisas históricas?

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.890
Ah, não é que seja falta de
interesse, é que isso...

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.380
Deprimido

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.650
Ah, claro que eu tenho!

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.120
Eu adoro lugares antigos!

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.260
Verdade?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.540
Então vamos logo aproveitar Kyoto!

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.910
Sim...

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.540
Vamos, rápido, rápido!

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.020
Aluguel de Kimonos

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.020
Kinoya

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.710
Agora, vou te ajudar a colocá-lo.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.430
Ah, eu posso fazer isso sozinha.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.300
Desculpe a demora.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.560
O que você acha?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.310
Você está realmente bonita.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.310
Obrigada.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.570
Não é um pouco cedo pra ficarem nesse clima todo amoroso?

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.320
Primeiro na área de serviços e agora em Kyoto! Não conseguem se controlar?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.080
Ch-Chitose?

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.330
Vocês três estão começando a se parecer com um certo trio de vilões.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.500
Não fique nos comparando
com animes antigos!

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.490
Eu sei que você está indo conhecer os pais dele ou algo parecido,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.280
mas em termos de parentesco, eu sou aquela que é mais próxima de você!

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.260
Nem chegamos perto disso.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.220
Significa que a menos que eu aceite esse casamento

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.890
ele não é legítimo, mesmo que tenha sido registrado.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.490
Bom, esse tipo de coisa
faz algum sentido?

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.140
Tenho certeza que sou capaz
de convencê-los.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.960
Nesse caso, por que não conversamos só nós dois?

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.840
Nasa-kun?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.300
Desculpe, eu queria passear
por Kyoto com você,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.280
mas quero que muitas pessoas nos felicitem pelo nosso casamento.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.550
Entendi.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.680
Espere, por que eu deveria—

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.340
Nesse caso, por que a Tsukasa-chan não vem conosco para comermos um pão gostoso?

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.520
E-E as cafeterias da moda?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.160
Com certeza, vamos conferir todas elas.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.670
Além disso...

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.670
Nós já temos os ingressos para o Museu do Mangá.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.300
E-Está tudo bem, podem ir se divertir.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.800
O-Obrigada, querido!

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.600
Agora, acho que devemos passear por Kyoto enquanto conversamos.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.590
É preciso mais do que falar para se entender alguém.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.950
A verdadeira natureza de alguém só aparece em situações íntimas!

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.400
E nesse caso, eu fingirei
ser a sua namorada

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.580
e você vai ter que me entreter!

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.850
E com base nisso,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.250
serei capaz de julgar se você é digno ou não para a Nee-sama!

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:41.170
Você vai ver... Vou provar
o quão inútil você é!

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.030
Então, se eu provar que sou digno da Tsukasa-chan,

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.640
você irá aceitar nosso casamento?

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.700
É claro!

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.140
Mas duvido que isso vá acontecer, baseado no que eu já vi.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.290
Entendo.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.650
Mas tenho certeza que você vai entender assim que ver como vou oferecer minha companhia.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.070
Francamente, de onde vem
toda essa confiança?

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.300
Se eu tiver que especificar...

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.030
Provavelmente vem do amor.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:02.600
Amor

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.650
Amor

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:02.690
Amor

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:02.730
Amor

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:02.770
Amor

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:02.810
Amor

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.860
Amor

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:02.900
Amor

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:02.940
Amor

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:02.980
Amor

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.020
Amor

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.060
Amor

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.110
Amor

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.150
Amor

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.190
Amor

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:03.230
Amor

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.270
Amor

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:03.310
Amor

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:03.360
Amor

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.400
Amor

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:03.440
Amor

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.480
Amor

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.520
Amor

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:03.560
Amor

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:03.610
Amor

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:03.650
Amor

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.690
Amor

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:03.730
Amor

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:03.770
Amor

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:03.810
Amor

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:03.860
Amor

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:03.900
Amor

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:03.940
Amor

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:03.980
Amor

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.020
Amor

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.660
Que tipo de bobagem não-científica é essa?

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.760
Ei, um riquixá!

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.180
Vamos dar uma volta naquilo!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.290
Ei, volte aqui!

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.030
Pão Francês

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.030
Menmendo

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.630
Então, o que você gosta nele?

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.230
Como?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.920
Estou falando do seu marido.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.950
Bem...

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.380
O que você viu no Nasa-san que te fez se apaixonar por ele?

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.550
Você sentiu borboletas no seu estômago?

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.200
Ele fez seu coração bater mais forte?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.360
B-Bem, eu não sei se...

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.010
Mas como vamos aceitar se você não responder?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.010
Eu nunca a vi reagir assim antes.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.940
Que fofa!

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.400
Então—

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.190
Já chega!

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.720
Bom, como posso dizer...

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.710
O que estou tentando dizer é...

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.680
E-Ele é... simplesmente adorável.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.200
Então foi amor à primeira vista?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.860
Ah, não, não!

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.530
Que inveja!

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.500
Não foi nada disso!

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.210
O que foi então?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.210
Entendi, ele é o tipo dela.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.410
B-Bem, por exemplo...

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.970
Certa vez, ele me apresentou à uma amiga...

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.890
Arisugawa Kaname-chan.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.340
Ela é muito responsável.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.930
Ele normalmente começa elogiando alguém.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.550
Acho que a personalidade influencia no modo como as pessoas falam.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.940
Então você pode dizer pelo modo como elas escolhem as palavras

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:24.940
se alguém tem uma perspectiva positiva ou negativa da vida.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.120
Então quando eu ouvi aquilo...

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.490
Eu pensei: "Oh, ele é realmente gentil".

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.580
Então ele é totalmente o seu tipo, não é?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.910
V-Você estava ouvindo o que eu disse?

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.950
Claro que sim!

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.130
Ele é exatamente o que você procurava, por dentro e por fora,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.610
e por isso você se decidiu casar com ele!

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.840
N-Não, o que estou dizendo é...

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.540
Estou errada?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.280
N-Não exatamente...

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.720
Eu sabia!

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.930
Passear de riquixá é mais interessante do que imaginei.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:56.680
Não é?

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.350
Eu pesquisei muito antes

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.730
e decidi que iria experimentar assim que viesse pra Kyoto.

Hã?

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.360
Ah, tem um lugar onde vendem um dango muito bom logo à frente.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.360
Pronto, aqui está!

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.240
Ouvi dizer que eles são muito bons.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.750
O que é isto? O sabor é incrível!

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.920
Verdade? Que bom.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.290
E isso foi algo que você pesquisou
para a viagem?

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.010
É claro!

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.810
Eu não poupo esforços, seja em provas na escola ou em encontros!

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.890
Entendo...

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.530
Mas eu duvido que a Nee-sama tenha interesse em lugares assim, mesmo tendo vindo até Kyoto.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.640
Você está certa sobre isso.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.550
Ela queria ir à uma padaria e para o Museu dos Mangás...

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.850
Eu meio que fiquei em pânico.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.190
Como eu pensei.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.540
Foi isso que eu quis dizer sobre você não saber nada sobre ela.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.780
E como você não sabe nada sobre ela...

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.120
Por que exatamente você
se apaixonou por ela?

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.040
Bem... sobre isso...

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.040
Há tanta coisa, que nem
sei por onde começar.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.270
Como?

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.710
Tipo, como o sorriso dela é bonito, ou quão boa cozinheira ela é

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.380
e não há limites para o quão adoráveis são os aspectos da personalidade dela.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.480
Isso não é diferente de mim!

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.750
Ela é sempre tão legal e tranquila!

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.020
E ela também é incrivelmente atlética!

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.810
Calma, a Tsukasa-chan é atlética?

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.620
Isso mesmo! Você se casou com ela e nem sabe disso?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.500
Está com inveja? Com inveja
de não saber disso?

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.320
M-Mesmo com tudo aquilo...

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.510
Ela é mesmo atlética? Como pode ser tão adorável?

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.080
Não use minhas palavras como combustível para as suas fantasias!

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.580
Eu odeio isso!

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.560
Francamente! Por que logo você?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.340
Espere!

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.590
Se a personalidade de alguém aparece no modo como ela usa as palavras,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.170
então tudo já ficou bastante óbvio.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.680
Porque eu conheço a Nee-sama...

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.980
E eu sei que esse é o tipo de pessoa que ela amaria.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.940
É por isso que odeio isto!

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.870
Eu a conheço muito melhor!

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.990
Eu a conheço há muito tempo e sei que a conheço muito bem!

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.940
Então por que ela escolhe se casar com você, alguém que não sabe nada?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.120
Chitose-chan... dois anos atrás, ela salvou minha vida.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.000
Eu me distraí e ia ser atropelado por um caminhão.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.760
Se ela não tivesse me protegido, eu teria morrido na hora.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.920
Então eu acho que tenho muita sorte.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.460
Ela também salvou minha vida.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.240
Não é por isso que me sinto sortudo.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.640
Me sinto sortudo porque a conheci.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.020
Dizem que isso é 0,0000034%.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.020
Isso é chamado de Equação de Drake...

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.280
Uma fórmula usada para explorar fantasias.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.200
Foi originalmente formulada para expressar a probabilidade de vida

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.650
que possa existir fora da Terra, no universo.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.780
Mas alguém usou uma variante disso

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.320
para expressar a possibilidade de encontrar a pessoa a qual você está destinada.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.530
A chance disso acontecer é 0,0000034%.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.800
Bom, essa equação não é muito confiável,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.360
então não é algo exatamente científico.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.430
Mas acho que pode ser algo mais próximo da verdade do que as pessoas imaginam.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.890
No momento em que a vi,
senti que era o destino.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.640
Não me importa que isso pareça ilógico

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.900
ou se ninguém entender.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.330
Mas...

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.280
Eu sinto que encontrei algo que estive procurando desde que nasci.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.660
Q-Quem se importa com destino?

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.890
No final, tudo se resume a um certo instinto!

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.620
Bernhard Riemann teorizou que a função zeta

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.930
preveria a distribuição dos número primos

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.030
e então, matemáticos do mundo todo passaram 150 anos

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.300
tentando provar que ele estava certo.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:01.200
Mesmo algo como ondas gravitacionais, que foi uma hipótese iniciada por Einstein

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.300
só foram comprovadas 100 anos depois.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:09.320
Alguns dos princípios mais científicos do mundo só foram comprovados

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.310
depois do intuito de alguém.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:16.320
Eu sei que não a conheço tão bem quanto você,

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.320
mas eu pretendo passar toda a minha vida provando que nosso amor é real.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.450
Você não se casa porque
o amor é provado...

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.290
Você se casa para provar o amor.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.630
Então você conseguiu convencer a Chitose?

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.300
Não tenho certeza.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.090
Mas ela disse que ia voltar para Tóquio.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.300
Entendo.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.610
Então eu acho que é hora de conhecer os seus pais.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.300
Sim.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:39.890
No próximo episódio

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.560
Então finalmente vou conhecer os seus pais.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.730
Você não tem que ficar nervosa, Tsukasa-chan!

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.390
Deixe que eu me preocupo com meus pais esquisitos.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.690
Acho que é mesmo tal pai, tal filho.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.400
Está bem, não vou me preocupar.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.600
F-Fico aliviado que você entendeu rápido.
