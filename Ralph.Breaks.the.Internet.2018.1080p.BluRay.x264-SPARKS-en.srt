Great, but can you make it

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,274
a little more challenging
this time?

it's Pac-Man.

Name one other thing
in this whole arcade

that is yellow and round
and eats dots.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,149
I can name two things.

16

Boom! I accept your apology.

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,597
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?

do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?

No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.

I don't know.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,830
I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,949
I might agree...

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,553
but look at those
two very specific

we're basically
just, like, zeroes and ones...

if there's more to life
than this?

there's not one single,

Are you the head of Al Gore?

1108

I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube...

1109
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,512
which means
I curate the content...

1110

at the Internet's most popular
video-sharing site.

1111
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,112

I don't have time to trifle...

Who?

1117
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,913
The man
with the undulating jowls.

1118
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,155
So?

she actually made the video.

1126
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,471
She's the one who told us
to come see you.

1127
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,716
No wonder
your video's so dope.

Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

1137

1146
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,677
viral videos can make,
like, actual money?

1147

Oh, hearts are money, honey.

Oh, no, no, no. (LAUGHING)

That's $43.

All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.

and I ask Shank really...

back to that death trap.

a whole bunch of videos...

of me doing all kinds of them
crazy things?

a lot of hearts fast.

1729
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,715
that's called
a kick in the face.

1730
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,279
I can't believe it.

1731
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,154
A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.

1732
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,795
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

1733
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,038
No, this can't be right.

1734
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,832
No, she's been brainwashed.

1735
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,115
That's what this is.

1736
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,229
Because the Vanellope I know

1737
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,793
would never abandon me
like that.

1738
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,552
I gotta get her out
of there now.

1739
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,836
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1740
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,235
I admire the impulse...

1741
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,311
but you charge in there
like some white knight...

1742
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,038
she's liable to hold it
against you.

1743
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,316
So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game

1744
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,549
that's obviously bad for her?

1745
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,755
Of course not.

1746
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,518
Then how do I make her leave?

1747
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,592
She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.

1748
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,957
Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...

1749
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,030
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

1750
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,318
-Who's asking?
-Whoa.

1751
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,879
Back home, me and the kid

1752
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,190
used to goof off
in this game called Tron.

1753
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,749
But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...

1754
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,956
and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.

1755
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,519
So, is there a way

1756
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,795
to do something
like that to Slaughter Race?

1757
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,188
Oh, there's ways.

go slow or something...

Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.

Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses

that make a program insecure.

You release him
into that Slaughter Race game,

1817
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,560
Arthur will find some defect
in the code.

1818
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,233
Then he'll copy that defect

1819
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,675
and spread it
all over the game...

is make sure the virus stays
in Slaughter Race.
